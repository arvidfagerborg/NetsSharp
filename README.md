# NetsSharp

NetsSharp is a portable C# wrapper for [the Nets REST API](https://shop.nets.eu/web/partners/appi).

It simplifies using their payment services greatly. You will need to be familiar with how their API works for this library to make sense.

## Installation

Use Nuget:

```
> Install-Package NetsSharp
```

## Using

```cs
var nets = NetsSharp.Nets.Create(
    "merchant id", 
    "token", 
    NetsSharp.Endpoints.Live);
var transactionId = await nets.RegisterAsync("order1", 100, "NOK",
    new RegisterOptions {
        RedirectUri = new Uri("http://localhost/return_from_nets")
    });
var terminalUri = nets.GetTerminalEndpoint(transactionId);
// Now redirect the user's browser to terminalUri.

// When the user hits the RedirectUri above:
await nets.SaleAsync(transactionId);
```

### Crediting transaction

```cs
// partial refund:
await nets.CreditAsync(transactionId, 
    new ProcessRequestOptions {
        TransactionAmount = 100,
        Description = "Refund because of downtime"
    });

// full refund
await nets.CreditAsync(transactionId);
```

### Querying transactions

```cs
var information = await nets.QueryAsync(transactionId);
```

### Exceptions

If something goes wrong, we throw exceptions. Exceptions are named after the documentation, and are all in the `NetsSharp.Exceptions` namespace.

### Merchant hosted

```cs
var nets = NetsSharp.Nets.Create(
    "merchant id", 
    "token", 
    NetsSharp.Endpoints.Live);
var transactionId = await nets.RegisterAsync("order1", 100, "NOK",
    new RegisterOptions {
        RedirectUri = new Uri("http://localhost/return_from_nets"),
        ServiceType = ServiceType.MerchantHosted
    });
```

### Parsing response codes

Nice little snippet for easily parsing the response code when the user is redirected back to you:

```cs
try
{
    if (Nets.InterpretResponseCode(responseCode)) 
    {
        await nets.SaleAsync(transactionId);
        // grant backend access to whatever resources you need
    }
}
catch (InvalidResponseException e) {
    // inspect e.Errors to see which fields had which mistakes.
}
```

## Monetary units

All amounts are given and expected to be in the lowest currency denomination. For dollars, this would be cents. For Norwegian kroner, this would be Ã¸re. This means you will probably have to multiply any amount you display to the user by 100.

## Integration tests

If you want to run the integration tests, you will need a test account to run against.

## Caveats

This wrapper is not complete. There are several parts of the API we haven't had use for, so we simply haven't implemented it.

Pull requests welcome.
